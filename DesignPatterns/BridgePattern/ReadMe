Bridge pattern:-

1) The Bridge design pattern allows you to separate the abstraction from the implementation.It is a structural design pattern.
2) Decouple abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.
3) It invloves an interface which acts as bridge between abstraction class and implementor class.

Where we should use it:-
1) When we need to avoid permanent bindings between abstraction and its implementation.
2) We need to share an implementation among multiple objects.
