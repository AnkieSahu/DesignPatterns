IDisposable pattern:-

1) We use Finalize method to release unmanaged resources(code like in vb6, windows api or using Com component).
2) If there is not any unmanaged code then no need to use Finalize. 
3) We can not directly call Finalize method, its called by Garbage collector. We dont have any control on it.
   We need to just define destructor.
4) There are 3 generations for objects, when any object find finalize method implemented i.e. destructor, 
   Then it put in Finalize Queue. Garbage collector frequently check for Generation 0, but rarely finalize queue.
